                                            At White Ocean, we aim to help you resolve every concern and doubt. We have compiled basic legal information to help you buy a house in India. Read through the following points and get in touch with us if you have any more queries.</p>
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>Non-resident Indians holding Indian passport do not require any permission from RBI for acquiring immovable property for bonafide residential purposes.</li>
                                            <li>Non-resident Indians holding Indian passport may pay the purchase consideration either by remittance of funds from abroad through normal banking channels or out of NRO/ NRE/ FCNR account.</li>
                                        </ol>
                                        <p>Get a copy of the title report by the solicitor of the property. Make sure that there are no conditions written in fine print and that there are no specific reservations by the state government.</p>
                                        <p>Look for specific clearance reports. For instance, if the construction is near a seafront, you will need to check for a Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) clearance. If the project is being constructed over or in the close vicinity of a heritage building, you must check for any heritage reservations for the premises. The idea is to ensure that you do not get stuck with a property that is or may get caught in any sort of disputes. Lack of clearance of titles also means that you will not be able to avail home loans.</p>
